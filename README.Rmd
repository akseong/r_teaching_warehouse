# R Teaching Warehouse
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a warehouse of teaching materials that I have developed (sometimes with others) over the years to use in courses and workshops; I keep the latest versions of these materials here. For more details on my courses, [visit my website](https://malco.io/training/).

Many elements of these materials were inspired by the [Master the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse) workshop offered by RStudio but generally focus more on the needs of health researchers. The Shiny materials here were heavily influenced by the [full day Shiny workshop](https://github.com/dtkaplan/shinymark) offered by RStudio. Additionally, the following collaborators have influenced or contributed to this work:

* [Corinne Riddell](https://corinne-riddell.github.io/)
* [Martin Frigaard](https://www.martinfrigaard.io/)
* [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/about/)
* [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/)
* [Richard Iannone](https://randr.rocks/)

My thanks to all of them, as well as RStudio,
